# A practical example

Transitioning from manual deployment to a structured Infrastructure as Code approach requires careful navigation through a complex landscape of tools and methodologies. While the ecosystem of infrastructure management is vast and intricate, our strategy focuses on a pragmatic, straightforward path that leverages our existing knowledge and minimizes unnecessary complexity.

We've chosen an immutable deployment strategy that combines two powerful tools: [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) for server templating and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for provisioning. This approach offers a strategic balance between simplicity and effectiveness, allowing us to modernize our infrastructure management without overwhelming our team with unnecessary complexity.

Packer and Terraform present an ideal entry point for our Infrastructure as Code journey. These client-only applications integrate seamlessly with our existing virtual machine infrastructure, requiring no additional complex setup. By building upon our familiar VM environment, we reduce the learning curve and implementation friction.

Our chosen approach does come with limitations. More advanced deployment strategies like blue-green deployments will be more challenging to implement. However, for our immediate goals, this method provides a robust, manageable solution that significantly improves our infrastructure consistency and repeatability.

This strategy represents more than a technological upgradeâ€”it's a calculated step towards more predictable, reproducible, and manageable infrastructure, setting the foundation for future scalability and innovation.
