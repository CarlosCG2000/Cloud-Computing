# Why?

In the evolving landscape of technology infrastructure, a fundamental shift is transforming how organizations manage and deploy their systems. Historically, infrastructure deployment was the exclusive domain of operations teams, working through manual processes and siloed approaches. However, the rise of cloud computing has revolutionized this paradigm, blending the roles of software development and operations into a more integrated, code-driven discipline.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) represents this transformative approach, where infrastructure is no longer managed through manual configurations or traditional administrative tasks, but instead defined, deployed, updated, and decommissioned through sophisticated code-based methodologies. This approach enables teams to treat infrastructure with the same rigor, version control, and programmatic precision traditionally applied to software development.

To measure the effectiveness of this approach, four critical metrics have emerged as key performance indicators for software delivery and operational excellence. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of an organization's technological agility and reliability:

* Delivery lead time tracks the speed of implementing, testing, and delivering changes to production, reflecting an organization's ability to rapidly respond to market needs.
* Deployment frequency measures how often changes are successfully pushed to production, indicating the team's capacity for continuous improvement and innovation.
* The change fail percentage reveals the reliability of these deployments by quantifying the proportion of changes that cause operational issues or require immediate correction.
* Finally, mean time to restore service assesses an organization's resilience by measuring how quickly systems can be recovered during unexpected disruptions.

By embracing Infrastructure as Code, organizations can achieve greater consistency, reduce human error, enhance scalability, and create more responsive and reliable technological ecosystems.
