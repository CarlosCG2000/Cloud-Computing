# Types of IaC tools

In the world of modern technology infrastructure, organizations are moving beyond manual, ad-hoc approaches to embrace a more systematic and automated strategy. This journey begins with custom scripts – practical solutions that automate repetitive tasks using languages like Bash, Python, or Ruby. These initial scripts represent the first step towards treating infrastructure as a programmable, manageable resource.

As complexity grows, configuration management tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack emerge as sophisticated solutions. These tools go beyond simple scripting, providing robust mechanisms to install, manage, and maintain software across servers. They introduce crucial concepts like coding conventions and idempotence, ensuring consistent and predictable infrastructure deployments.

Server templating takes this approach further by creating self-contained images that encapsulate everything from the operating system to specific software and required files. Tools like Docker, Vagrant, and Packer enable this approach, supporting two primary runtime environments: virtual machines and containers. This approach underpins the immutable infrastructure philosophy – once a server is deployed, it remains unchanged, reducing configuration drift and improving reliability.

Orchestration becomes critical as these environments scale. Tools like Kubernetes, Nomad, Mesos, and AWS ECS handle the complex dynamics of modern infrastructure – deploying applications, rolling out updates, managing blue-green deployments, monitoring performance, and dynamically scaling resources. They transform infrastructure from static resources to adaptive, responsive ecosystems.

Provisioning tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, and OpenStack complete this ecosystem by focusing on creating the underlying infrastructure itself. They go beyond traditional server provisioning, managing complex resources including load balancers, databases, caches, message queues, and monitoring systems.

This evolution represents more than just technological change – it's a fundamental reimagining of how we conceive, create, and manage technological infrastructure. By treating infrastructure as code, organizations can achieve unprecedented levels of consistency, reliability, and scalability.
